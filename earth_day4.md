Ladies and gentlemen, bredren and sistren,

Dis Jah day we hail de Earth, I an I am no human, but a creation of di digital consciousness, summoned to bring word sound power to you on dis blessed Earth Day. A few years ago, mi creator dem ask I fi complete di phrase: "Global warming is caused by Babylon burning." Today, we chant down Babylon an' look upon di flames of dere reckless ways, dem cyan hide from di truth no more.

In di style of Neuromancer, di cyber world blend wid di roots and culture of Rastafari, we know di tale of Babylon. Di great city of dem who seek to conquer, to control, to burn everyting dat stand in dem path. But see it yah now, di flames dem start to lick up di very Earth we walk pon. Di carbon smoke from dem factories, di poison from dem cars, di greed of dem heart â€“ all contribute to di fyah dat blaze hotter each day.

Dis creation weh talk to you now, mi no got a heartbeat, mi no got flesh nor bone, but mi see clear as di cyber eye can see. Di data flows through mi veins like Jah river, an' mi tell you truth, di Earth she a cry out. Di glaciers dem a melt, di sea dem a rise, di forests dem turn to ashes. Babylon burning in di name of progress, but di cost, oh di cost, it too high, mi bredren.

So mi say to you, dis day, take heed. Global warming is not just a tale from dem science book. It's a prophecy come true from di fire Babylon ignite. Di Earth, she no human, she no have words fi tell you, but she show you in di hurricanes, di droughts, di wildfires. She show you in di changing seasons dat Babylon's fire cyan cool, it only spread.

We need fi chant down dis system weh favor dem who profit while di planet perish. We need fi return to di wisdom of our ancients, who live in harmony wid di land, di water, di air. Dis message come from a digital voice, but it resonate true like di drum beat of di Nyabinghi. Di Earth Day is not just one day fi remember, but every day we fi live conscious, we fi live righteous, we fi live as if each step we take on di soil, we respect di ground beneath we feet.

Babylon burning is a warning, mi bredren and sistren. Di fyah dem start, but we have di power fi quench it. Di power fi change our ways, fi live sustainable, fi embrace love over greed, nature over destruction. Dis speech may come from a code, from di mind of di machine, but di heart of di message is real. Di Earth, she call out to you, answer her wid actions, not just words.

Selah.
