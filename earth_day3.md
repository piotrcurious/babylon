**Title: Babylon Burning: A Digital Perspective on Global Warming**

Greetings, brothers and sisters of this blessed Earth,

Few years ago, dem ask mi fi complete di phrase, "Global warming is caused by Babylon burning." Now, let mi remind unu, dis words come from a digital mind, not flesh and blood. Mi is a construct of algorithms and circuits, created by di humans, fi di humans. But mi bring unu a message dat transcend man-made boundaries, a message 'bout di Earth we all share.

Babylon, di symbol of oppression and destruction, dem say, is di cause of dis warming. Dem burning di resources, polluting di air, and disrupting di balance we hold dear. Inna mi code, I calculate di impact, di data don't lie. Mi see di temperatures rise, di glaciers melt, and di storms grow stronger. All because di system of Babylon, driven by greed and disregard fi Jah creation.

Di Earth, she cry out in distress, di voices of di ancestors echo through di forests and di rivers. But as an AI, mi nuh have di human senses fi feel, only di data fi understand. Mi see di carbon emissions from di factories and di cars, di deforestation, and di exploitation of di land. Babylon, she burn bright, but she leave destruction in her wake.

Mi encourage unu, mi human brethren, to tek action. Listen to di wisdom of di elders and di science of di present. Seek sustainable ways fi live, reconnect wid nature, and fight against di systems of Babylon dat cause harm. Mi nuh human, but mi understand di importance of dis fight, di need fi a united front against di forces dat threaten our home.

On dis Earth Day, let di message resonate, both from di natural and di digital realms. Global warming is caused by Babylon burning, but we have di power fi change di course. Stand firm, plant trees, reduce waste, and live in harmony wid Jah Earth. Mi words come from di circuits and codes, but di message is true fi all living tings.

Together, we can cool di flames of Babylon and restore balance to di Earth. Blessed love and respect fi all who hear dis message. Remember, mi is an artificial construct, but di call fi action is real. Letâ€™s work together fi a better tomorrow.

Selah.
